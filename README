copytext is a library for accessing a spreadsheet as a native Python object suitable for templating.

On the NPR Visuals team we use this as part of our app-template. Whenever a project is rendered we fetch a spreadsheet from Google Docs, which is used to fill in all the editable copy in our project. This allows us to give our writers and editors a document to write in which they are more comfortable with than they would be editing the code directly.
